				The trapeziometacarpal joint, was his understanding of the term. That's the joint that connects your wrist to your thumb. A thumb is at once a finger and not a finger, and the TMC is no different. It's taxonomically the same category as the other carpometacarpals and, colloquially, not even close to the same category.

				Clare had this weird habit of sort of turning and flexing his thumb on this joint before he thought he was going to have to put his thumb through some serious work. This applied to both hands. It was his version of something you might see a pitcher or a pro wrestler do, where they take their left hand and place it on their right shoulder and start spinning their right arm in a sort of revving-up motion. As a stretch it's not that useful, but the effect on crowds is palpable. Except that no one was watching Clare get ready to churn out a couple quick apps at 10:56 Wednesday morning, plus any repetitive motion of the hands sort of just ends up making one look like a type of maniac anyway, if anyone happened to be passing by the tiny basement window, if anyone's carefully-honed attention to sudden motion drew their eye to what appeared to be a wildly-flailing man in a basement window sitting in front of a computer, one hand wildly flailing, one hand wrist-deep in an xtra-large bag of My Essentials&trade; Brand Trail Mix W/ Rainbow Chocolate Candies.

				Just really hammering apps today, really putting the ol' TMC through her paces today, was the plan. Clare had removed the heptagon of cardboard from his window. The heptagon had originally been on of six sides of a box that had held a few disparate items that Clare had shipped from his parent's house on the outskirts of Bloomington IN to his first sublet ever, located in NY NY, which his father had referred to as "the capital of the world." Clare had one morning ripped one of the six sides of the box that had held mostly bedding and a few books and had propped the resultant heptagon in front of the basement window that exposed his space in the sublet to the outside. It was an irregular heptagon ripped hastily at 3:42 in the morning on Clare's first night/morning in the sublet, when it became clear that cars really didn't stop driving by, and that lights really wouldn't stop passing across Clare's face at all, in the night.

				The gripping and tearing motion involved in this sort of bleary-eyed operation depends heavily on the action of opposition that is facilitated by the trapeziometacarpal joint. And it's only a coincidence that the heptagon also happens to block sunlight as well as the light from passing cars, which sunlight would almost assuredly wake Clare before the double-digit hours of the morning, throwing off his rhythm and maybe causing him to lose a whole day or more of just crushing online apps.
			</p>

				Here's the thing: there's no point in getting up at any particular time, right? All the job apps nowadays are online anyway. It's not like you can stop by an office build and, like, ask for an application. Accordingly, there's no point in keeping yourself tied to regular business hours. This is maybe the one thing that the jobless have as an advantage over people with jobs, nowadays, in our modern age. They get to keep their own schedule. And they dress however they want, and order delivery food for lunch because there is no lunch break, there are no working hours, your time is not your own until you find employment, which is awful, but maybe the one cool thing about that circumstance is that it's reasonable for you to order delivery even if the place is down the street and the food isn't very good for you.
